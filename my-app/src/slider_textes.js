What sets this platform apart from others in the industry is its focus on nurturing talents rather than pursuing profits. I discovered this amazing platform through my son's school parents' group, and I am grateful to be a part of it now.",

I personally love these platforms because very few platforms plan to give art appreciation and CAMI does it with all its heart.",

The fact that you are willing to sell their paintings is an added advantage. With both of them winning in April and May, it has been a wonderful experience. I have already recommended your website to a colleague.",

It is a very good place for children to keep their artwork in one place and also get recognised. The themes for the monthly challenges are a mix of contemporary and traditional.
